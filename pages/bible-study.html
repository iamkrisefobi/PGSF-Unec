        <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p>The word of God is the intent, will and purpose of God revealed to mankind. It is also a medium of communication from God to man. The word of God is a manual for daily living for believers and beyond that; the word of God is God himself (Jn 1:1). It is the basic element for the equipping of the saints for good works (2 Tim 3:16-17).</p>
        <h4>Discussion Questions</h4>
          <ol class="study__questions">
            <li><span>What is the word of God?</span> Jn 1:1-4; 14, Jn 6:63; Jn 17:17, Eph 6:17,Heb 4:12. </li>
            <li><span>What are the attributes of the word?</span> Jn 6:63, Heb 11:3, 4:12-13, 1 Pet 1:23; 25, 1 Thes 2:13, Prov 30:5, Jer 23:29, Acts 19:20 </li>
            <li><span>How do I benefit from the word?</span> Jas 1:21-23, Heb 11:6,8, Josh 1:8, Psalm 119:9-11

            <li><span>What are the Barriers to benefitting from the word?
            </span> Heb 4:2, Matt 13:18-22, Eph 4:17-18, 2 Cor 3:14-16
            </li>
            <li><span>What are the benefits of the word?

            </li>
          </ol>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
          <p>The word of God plays an indispensable role in the life of believers. The study of the word is pivotal to the equipping of the saints for good works, because the word enables us to be modeled after Christ. Believers are therefore invited to not only be hearers alone, but also doers of the word.</p>
        <h4 class="study__memory-verse">Memory Verse</h4>
          <p>For the word of God is living and powerful and sharper than any two edged sword piercing even to the division of soul and spirit and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. (Heb 4:16) NKJV</p>

          <p class="study__text">Text: 2 Tim. 3:16-17, Ps. 119:130</p>

      <div class="collapsible__content study__body">
        <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p>The word of God is powerful, pure and of great value. The word of God is able to keep a man from sin (Psa. 119:9-11). Efficacy implies the ability to produce a desired or an intended result. The word of God has the ability to accomplish the set goal of which God sent it to accomplish (Psa. 107:20). In this study, we are trusting that God will grant us understanding on the efficacy of his word.</p>
        <h4>Discussion Questions</h4>
          <ol class="study__questions">
            <li><span>What is the word of God?</span> (Gen. 1:1-24, John 1:1-5,14, Heb 4:12-13, Psalm 119:105, 2 Tim 3:16-17)
            </li>
            <li><span>What is the efficacy of the word of God?</span> (Psa. 19:7, Psa. 119:9,11, 107:20, 2 Tim. 3:16-17, Heb. 4:12) </li>
            <li><span>What are the dangers of taking the Word of God for granted? </span> (John 3:19, Psalm 50:16-17, Isa. 5:1-7, Rom 1:28, Neh 9:26-27)
            </li>
            <li><span>What is the joy of taking heed to the Word of God?
            </span> (John 15:7, Prov. 3:1-4, Prov. 2:1-6, Psalm 119:11, Rev. 22:11-13)
            </li>
          </ol>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
          <p>The word of God is not an opinion of any man neither is it a compilation of men's philosophies and fables. Rather, it is the spoken mind of God (2 Peter 1:20-21). Therefore, the Word of God is sure and irrevocable thus we can base and invest our lives on it. </p>
          <p>The world and everything in it came to existence via the word of God so put your trust solely on it for it's all you need to go through life and get to heaven.</p>

      <div class="collapsible__content study__body">
        <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p>Consecration is a process or practice of making something or someone sacred, dedicated and set apart for the Lord. It also means the devoting or setting apart of anything or anyone to the worship or service of God (Exodus 28:41). The race of Abraham and the levites were thus consecrated (Num 3:12). According to the Mosaic Law, the firstborn male of both man and beast were consecrated to God (Exo 13:2, 12, 15). In the New Testament, Christians are regarded as consecrated to the Lord (1 Pet 2:9, Rom 12:1)

            </li>
          </ol>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
          <p>As children of God and citizens of his kingdom, God expects us to live a life of purity, holiness and consecration to him as a peculiar people and a royal priesthood (1 Pet 2:9). God desires that we separate ourselves from the world (Rom 12:2) and consecrate ourselves solely for his purposes on earth.

      </div>
      <div class="collapsible__content study__body">
        <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p>Separation is from the word 'to separate', and to separate connotes being different, unique, and apart and being seen in a different light. Because of the call of God upon our lives, and the demand of God upon us as His dear children, there are so many things we cannot go with. Actually, the truth is, others may, but we cannot. (1 Pet. 2 vs 9)

            <li><span>What are we called to separate from?</span> Rom. 12 vs 2, 2 Cor. 6 vs 17, 1 Pet. 2 vs 1, 1 Jhn. 2 vs 15-17, 1 Pet. 4 vs 1-4, 1 Pet. 3 vs 8-11  </li>
            <li><span>What are the consequences of lack of separation</span> Jas. 4 vs 4-5, Jhn. 15 vs 6, 1 Pet. 3 vs 12, 2 Pet. 2 vs 4-6, 13-15, 2 Pet. 3 vs 9-14

            </li>
          </ol>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
          <p>As children of God, we are called to be the light and salt (Matt. 5 vs 13-16), to live not as the world live (Rom. 12 vs 1-2), but to live a life that gives pleasure to God at all times (Rev. 4 vs 11). We cannot live this life except we separate ourselves unto God alone. When we separate ourselves to God, we get his blessing, but when we refused to, we get his wrath. May God grant us grace and understanding to know and do his bidding. God bless us all.</p>

      <div class="collapsible__content study__body">
        <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p>Dying to self is a great and necessary step in doing the will of God, when all that matters to one is to honour God. It can be willingness to give up everything, even one's own life, for God's will to be done (Phil. 3:7-11). Dying to self was exemplified by the three Hebrew children (Dan. 3:16-18).
          </p>
        <h4>Discussion Questions</h4>
          <ol class="study__questions">
            <li><span>What is dying to self?</span> Matt. 26:39; Dan. 3:16-18; Phil. 1:20-21; 2-3, Matt. 16:24-25 </li>
            <li><span>Why should we die to self?</span> Luke 21:34; 1 Cor. 7:35; Rom. 8:5-8, Phil.3:3  </li>

            </li>
          </ol>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
          <p>Dying to self is an important way to be equipped for every good work. It is a way of putting to death everything we are, and taking up the cause of our Lord Jesus Christ at all cost.</p>
        <h4 class="study__memory-verse">Memory Verse</h4>
          <p>For I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me. (Gal. 2:20).

        <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p>The mind is what reveals the state of a man whether he is spiritual or carnal. It is the centre of a man's decision; it is that which defines a man's personality. For a man to have a smooth relationship with God and the brethren, the mind must in a state where it is pure and not contaminated/polluted by any form of worldly impurities. In this study, we seek to understand what the mind is, how to renew it, the danger of failing to renew it and the benefits of renewing it. May the grace of God be made available to use as we study.
          </p>
        <h4>Discussion Questions</h4>
          <ol class="study__questions">
            <li><span>What do you understand by the human mind?</span></li>

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
          <p>An un-renewed mind cannot please nor serve God, this is because the mind he/she carried is the mind of the Adamic nature which God declares to be an enemy of anything God.</p>
          <p>The only way to live and please God adequately is to renew your mind. God cannot trust an un-renewed mind. May God help us to renew our mind.</p>

      <div class="collapsible__content study__body">
        <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p>Obedience is the act of doing what you are asked to do without going contrary to it. As children of God, we are called to obedience, because in obedience lies every blessing that God has in stock for us (Isa. 1:19). If we want to go far with God obedience is cardinal. King Saul lost his place in God because of disobedience (1Sam. 15: 22-23, 16:1). In this study, we seek to understand what obedience is, how to be obedient, the dangers of disobedience and the benefits of obedience.
          </p>
        <h4>Discussion Questions</h4>
          <ol class="study__questions">
            <li><span> What is your understanding of Obedience?</span></li>
            <li><span>How can we practice obedience?</span> John 15:4-10, Psa. 119:9-11, Prov. 3:5-7, 2 Tim.3:16-17, Eph 5:22, 6:1-8, Josh 1:8, Rom 13:1</li>
            <li><span>What are the consequences of disobedience?</span> Deut. 28:15-45, 1 Sam.16:1, Matt.3:10, John 15:6
            </li>
            <li><span>What are the benefits of Obedience?
            </span>  Isa. 1:19, 2 Cor.6: 17-18, 2 Cor. 3:18, Eph. 1:3-5, Deut. 28:1-12
            </li>
          </ol>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
          <p>The bible says that Obedience is better than sacrifice (1 Sam. 15:22b), this shows the value God put on obedience because it is he who has the ability to obey that can fulfill the will of God.</p>
          <p>Obedience like the hymn writer says is the only way for us to be happy in Jesus, Trust and Obey for there is no other way to be happy in Jesus but to trust and obey. May God grant us grace to be obedient</p>

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
          <p>Submission entails putting God's will above all others, even ours. We have our ways and plans, but when God interrupts those plans, we are duty bound to submit to Him. When we submit to God, He will use us to accomplish His will.</p>

        <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p>Prayer is an earnest communication, on the deepest possible level, of our feelings and desires to God, and God doing same to us. The Holy Spirit helps us to express those deepest feelings to God (Romans 8:26).And this is a two-way thing. He also communicates God's deep desire for us. It has always been mistaken by many to be only an act of supplications to God when one is out of options, but it is not. Prayer is not just talking. Sometimes in our prayer we need to stop talking. We need to be still and know that he is God.” (Psalms 46:10).</p>

          </ol>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
          <p>Prayer may be in form of praise to God, adoration, contrition, supplication, thanksgiving or intercession (1 Timothy 2:1-3, Psalm 150:1-6). While on earth, Jesus was a man of prayer, this was his only way of keeping in constant touch with his heavenly father. As Christians, our intimacy with God is renewed through constant prayer and study of his word. This (relentless prayer) was the life of the early church which all Christians must emulate (Acts 1:12-14). A prayerless man is a fainting man (Luke 18:1).</p>

      <div class="collapsible__content study__body">
        <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p>When we think of waiting, we often think of passivity, which is practically synonymous with doing nothing. When the Bible speaks of waiting, it's an entirely different thing. It entails absolute dependence upon God and obedience to him. Thus, waiting upon God is a spiritual discipline that we should seek to practice in our lives</p>
        <h4>Discussion Questions</h4>
          <ol class="study__questions">

          </ol>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
          <p>While COVID-19 has certainly brought much confusion, pain, and death to the world, we ought to also consider what positive lessons we are to learn from God through these difficult days. And at least one lesson we all can benefit from is a better understanding of what it means to wait upon the Lord. He is sovereign over all things, and we depend on him for our very next breath. So let us express our dependence by waiting patiently, avoiding worry, and living obediently, while seeking him in prayer, expecting him to save as we long for Christ's final return.</p>

          <p class="study__text">Text: 1 Jhn. 1:3-7</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="collapsible__content study__body">
        <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p>Right from the beginning, man was created to fellowship. We know from Genesis that God used to come down to the garden in the cool of the day (Gen.3:8) to commune with man. Aside fellowship with God, man also fellowship with each other. So, man is a creation of fellowship. Man was not made a loner. Even after the fall, man still get together, drawn by different things like blood relationships, social status, professions, political associations, unionisms, etc. Therefore, fellowship is a very vital aspect of life in Gods kingdom. 
          </p>
        <h4>Discussion Questions</h4>
          <ol class="study__questions">
            <li><span>What is our common understanding of fellowship?</span>
            </li>
            <li><span>What does fellowship involve?</span> 1 John 1:3, Acts2:44-46, Heb.10:24-25, Matt.18:20, 1 Cor.1:9-10, Phil.2:1, Psalms 55:14, Psalms 133:1
            </li>
            <li><span>What is the danger of wrong fellowship?</span>1 Cor.15:33, Prov. 13:20, Matt. 26:69-74, 2 Chron. 18:3,31, 2 Chron. 19:1-2
            </li>
            <li><span>What are the benefits of correct fellowship?

            </li>
          </ol>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
          <p>Man cannot be all that God wants him to be in isolation. The reason God seeks man to fellowship daily with him in prayers and study of the word is to enable him fully walk in his will for him. No man who consistently fellowships with God lacks his presence and grace.

      </div>
      <div class="collapsible__content study__body">
        <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p>The subject matter of discipleship has become even more important today than in any other generation. Though basic and very crucial, it has become a neglected subject. As we sit together at HIS feet to look at the matter, we must bow our hearts and seek a divine revelation of the WORD. We must pray continually as we study and seek a fresh encounter with the LORD HIMSELF at every stage.</p>
        <h4>Discussion Questions</h4>
          <ol class="study__questions">
            <li><span>What do you understand by the term discipleship?</span></li>

            </li>
          </ol>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
          <p>Discipleship for each person is unique and peculiar to the individual. The pace, the instrumentality, and arrangement of lessons, and dealings as determined by the MASTER is also unique. The path each must tread to glory, the portion of service and talents allotted is also unique. No disciple should compare CHRIST'S dealings with him with another disciple's. We can say in summary that discipleship is therefore, a personal apprenticeship of a Christian under the MASTER (JESUS) with the view of becoming like HIM. It involves direct encounter and interactions with the MASTER HIMSELF in prayer, in his word, in service and in following in HIS foot-steps (1 Pet. 2:21; Jn. 8:8-10). When the disciple has made real progress in his discipleship programme with the LORD, his character, deeds and manner of life and speech will obviously show to those around that he …had been with JESUS. (Acts 4:13; Matt. 26:69-73; Acts 11:26). </p>

      </div>
      <div class="collapsible__content study__body">
        <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p>Zeal generally refers to a fervent desire to accomplish a particular feat. The Bible tells us that Christ died on the cross to redeem a people who would then become zealous for good works. Good works are about mission, evangelism, and key characteristics that build credibility to what God called His community to be in the world. They show what salvation is for and how mission can be fueled by a walk that matches the talk. Many believers during periods of great persecution zealously gave their lives for the gospel's sake. Acts 15:26 tells of men who “risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.”Every Christian should strive to be zealous in his service to the Lord.

        <h4>Discussion Questions</h4>
          <ol class="study__questions">
            <li><span>What does it mean to be zealous for good works?</span></li>
            <li><span>What kind of works are Christians called to do?</span> Micah 6 vs 8, Gal 6 vs 2:9-10, Luke 3 vs 4:10-14, Isa 58 vs 6-9, Heb 6 vs 10, Mark 16 vs 15, Act 9 vs 36, 39 </li>
            <li><span>What do you think from the following scriptures would hinder a Christian from doing good works?</span> Daniel 1:8, Acts 5:1–10, 1 Tim 6:10, John 9:22, 1 Cor 15:33
            </li>
            <li><span>What are the benefits of good works?

            </li>
          </ol>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
          <p>One of the major challenges Christians face today is figuring out how to declare “the gospel” in a world that no longer wants to hear what we have to say. The book of Titus 2 vs 14 tells us that God has purified unto Himself a peculiar people, zealous unto good works. We are to walk worthy of this call in order to fulfill the purpose of God in our lives.</p>

        <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p>Evangelism is telling what God has done, spreading the good news of salvation to mankind (John 3:16) and equipping the new converts to grow in faith, grace and God's wisdom. This supersedes merely leading someone to pray the "sinner's prayer."It is a divine responsibility of every Christian (Ezekiel 3:17–19, Matthew 28:19-20). Our lord derives pleasure from our evangelical work (Luke 12:8) and he sends his spirit to lead us in situations we lack the right thing to say (Luke 12:11-12).

          </ol>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
          <p>In evangelism, we are reminded not to get upset or weary when we don't see the results immediately or any visible sign of interest or convictions. Our duty is to share God's message, but God causes it to take root and grow into faith, bearing in mind that we are playing an important role in the harvest (1 Corinthians 3:6–9).</p>

        <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p>Brotherliness/brotherly love is showing kindness or love to our Christian brothers and sisters. In a general sense, it can also mean showing love and kindness to all mankind. It means eschewing covetousness, selfishness, greed, and loving another as one loves oneself. As we grow in knowing God, we are also expected to grow in brotherly love as well. Then we will be more productive and useful to God.</p>

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
          <p>We are required to show brotherly love to believers as well as all people. Brotherly love is without preference to persons or time. The basis of this brotherly love is faith in God. We are called to attend to the need of our “brothers” at all times in order to show God to them (1 Jn. 3:17), and also to glorify God (Ps. 133:1).</p>

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
          <p>As human beings, we can achieve very little with our own strength and wisdom, hence the need to rely completely on the Holy Spirit. When we are empowered by the Holy Spirit, we gain the enablement to live the Christian life and fulfill our purpose on earth.</p>

        <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p>When we are connected and intentional about our relationship with God, we produce the fruit God cultivates within us. It is God who does the work in us; our fruit-bearing is simply a result of what He does. Jesus said, "You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide…" (John 15 vs 6).Bearing fruit in the Christian life is not about doing works or attempting righteousness in our own strength. Rather, it is about intentionally growing in our walk with Christ, inviting the Holy Spirit's work of transformation in us, and actively obeying God in all He calls us to do. As we seek Him and lay down our own fleshly desires for His better ways, we will bear lasting fruit and serve as salt and light to a world in need of Jesus (Matthew 5:13–16).

        <h4>Discussion Questions</h4>
          <ol class="study__questions">
            <li><span>What does it mean to bear fruit as a Christian?</span>
            </li>
            <li><span>What type of fruit does God want us to bear?</span> Matt. 5:44, Mark 11 vs 22-24, Gal 5 vs 22-23, Col. 3 vs 22-24, Dan 1 vs 8, Gen 39 vs 8-9.
            </li>
            <li><span>How can a Christian bear fruit?</span>1 John 4 vs 13, 2 Cor. 3 vs 18, Phil 1 vs 19, Rom 8 vs 9, John 15 vs 4-5, 2 Tim 2 vs 22, Rom 1 vs 16, Dan 12 vs 3, 2 Tim 2 vs 2
            </li>
            <li><span>What hinders a Christian from bearing fruit?
            </span> Matt 13 vs 22, Mark 4 vs 19, Luke 8 vs 4,Jn 15 vs 6, Gal 5 vs 19, Rom 8 vs 5-8, Rev 3 vs 15-16.
            </li>
          </ol>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
          <p>What makes the elect distinct from the rest is that they fulfill the purpose of their calling by bearing fruit to the glory of God. Alot of Christians are carried away by the deceitfulness of riches, the cares of this world and the pleasures of this life. These hindrances, aside from rendering them unfruitful, ruins their relationship with God and makes them unworthy of being part of the elect who shall inherit the kingdom of heaven.

        <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p>Just before Jesus ascended into heaven, He said, “Ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you”. (Acts 1:8).This promise of power comes when the Holy Spirit dwells in you, empowering you to witness, strengthening your Christian walk, and equipping you for Christian service. As our life is empowered by the Holy Spirit, spiritual gifts or new abilities called the “gifts of the holy spirit” enable us to do the Lord's work in new and powerful ways. But we must also know that the Gifts of the spirit are given as the father desires (Eph 4:7-8) and not a product of our working. Although, we can position ourselves to receive the gifts of the spirit by desiring them (I cor 14:1).</p>
          <p>The purpose of spiritual gifts is not for our own self interest, but for the benefit and edification of the body of Christ (Eph 4:12). There is diversity of gifts but they all proceed from the same spirit (I Cor 12:4) and serve the same goal.
          </p>
        <h4>Discussion Questions</h4>
          <ol class="study__questions">
            <li><span>Discuss the various gifts of the spirit.
            </span> 1 Cor 12:4-11, Rom 12:3-8, Eph 4:4-14</li>
            <li><span>What are the Purposes/benefits of the gifts of the spirit?
            </span> 1 Cor 14:12, 26, 1 Cor 12:6-7, Eph 4:3, 12-13, 1 Pet 4:10-11, 1 Cor 14:31
            </li>
            <li><span>How do we receive the gifts of the spirit?
            </span> 1 Cor 12:31, 14:1,12, 1 Cor 13:1-3, 1 Tim 4:14, 2 Tim 1:6-7, 1 Cor 14:39-40, Rom 1:11, Luke 11:11-13
            </li>
          </ol>
        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
          <p>God has endowed his body with diverse kinds of Gifts. Irrespective of the kind we've received, let us be committed to use it 'for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry and for the edifying of the body of Christ'. (Eph 4:9) KJV</p>
